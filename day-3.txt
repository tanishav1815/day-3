    <h1>CSS- interview questions</h1>
    ques1:-Difference between flex row and column
    <!-- ans-1:-
    it is a property of flexbox
    row: items flow horizontally
    column: items flow vertically

    Items display in a row (the flex-direction property's default is row ).
     The items start from the start edge of the main axis. 
     The items do not stretch on the main dimension, but can shrink.
      The items will stretch to fill the size of the cross axis.

      The flex-direction CSS property sets how flex items are placed in the flex container
       defining the main axis and the direction (normal or reversed) -->

ques-2:- Explain inline , internal and external stylesheet
ans:2:-
<!-- Internal or embedded CSS requires you to add <style> tag in the <head> section of your HTML document. -->

    <!-- /* INTERNAL - This CSS style is an effective method of styling a single page.  -->
    <!-- However, using this style for multiple pages is time-consuming as you need to put CSS rules on every page of your website. */ -->

    <!-- With external CSS, you’ll link your web pages to an external .css file, which can be created by any text editor in your device (e.g., Notepad++). -->

 <!-- This CSS type is a more efficient method, especially for styling a large website. By editing one .css file, you can change your entire site at once. */ -->

ques-3:-Justify-content allows you to do what?
ans-3:-
<!-- The justify-content property is a sub-property of the Flexible Box Layout module.

It defines the alignment along the main axis. It helps distribute extra free space leftover when either all the flex items on a line are inflexible, or are flexible but have reached their maximum size. It also exerts some control over the alignment of items when they overflow the line.

The justify-content property accepts five different values:

flex-start (default): items are packed toward the start line
flex-end: items are packed toward to end line
center: items are centered along the line
space-between: items are evenly distributed in the line; first item is on the start line, last item on the end line
space-around: items are evenly distributed in the line with equal space around them -->
<!-- space-evenly: items are distributed so that the spacing between any two adjacent alignment subjects, before the first alignment subject, and after the last alignment subject is the same -->
